Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)

"This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by
Tsavo Knott as part of the Runtime Framework or Mesh Intelligent Communications.

Tsavo Knott hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
transfer and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this
implementation of Runtime, where such license applies only to those
patent claims, both currently owned or controlled by Tsavo Knott and acquired
in the future, licensable by Tsavo Knott that are necessarily infringed by
this implementation of Runtime.  This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of
this implementation.  If you or your agent or exclusive licensee
institute or order or agree to the institution of patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that this implementation of Runtime or any code
incorporated within this implementation of Runtime constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent
infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
for this implementation of Runtime shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.
